left ,Kalonica Quigley,3D Game,"Quigley is a Melbourne-based 3D animator and game maker. Her game Apartment was born out of her personal experience during the COVID-19 pandemic, where she was forced to leave home. As a response to the lockdowns, she created this game that served as a digital memory of the place she had called home for so long, as a way of preserving her connection to the place. In Apartment players are invited to explore a 3D stylised recreation of her apartment with objects scattered around the apartment serving as a trigger for players to piece together her story. The environment is quiet with no other humans or animals in sight, cleverly replicating the pandemic conditions. I found the 3D environmetn and personal story behind it incredibly inspiring. The way Quigley used game design as a medium to communicate her story has had a strong influnce in the design of my workbooks where the main page of the workbook is a 3D replica of my bedroom.",https://acmi-website-media-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/ApartmentScreenshot_03.width-2208.png,https://findnicegames.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Untitled_1.1.1-19.jpg,"Kalonica Quigley, Apartment, 2021","Kalonica Quigley, Apartment, 2021",https://www.acmi.net.au/whats-on/women-non-binary-gamers-club/apartment/,"3D, Game, InteractiveMedia",

His personal portfolio allows users to navigate a 3D environment using a small virtual car interacting with other elements in the scene. This makes his portfolio stand out and creates an immersive gamified experience. When I first discovered his website last year, I was drawn to the way he reimagined what a portfolio could be. The blend of interactivity and technical skill deeply resonated with me. Since then, I have been wanting to explore ThreeJS. I finally tried it for my workbooks and ended up really enjoying it and hope to use it as my actual portfolio website.

One of their most memorable projects for me was their 2019 annual passion project Nomadic Tribe - a stunning interactive experience created as a tribute to the French comic book artist Jean Giraud, also known as Moebius. Nomadic Tribe stood out to me not just for its visuals but for how seamlessly it blended interactivity and narrative. The website is structured as a journey through illustrated environments inspired by Moebius' aesthetic. Each chapter is designed with unique interactive moving elements that guide the user to the next chapter. Rather than simply scrolling through a story, the user is invited to a meditative experience that rewards patience and exploration. I have often found myself returning to this website to re read and explore the interactions again.

In this work the artists employ an industrial robot with one specific duty, to contain a deep red liquid within a predetermined area. When the sensors detect that the fluid has strayed too far, the arm frenetically shovels it back into place.
I believe this piece has a strong visual and emotional impact. At first glance, the robotic arm is mesmerising, but as you watch it try to endlessly contain the fluid, the piece begins to highlight deeper themes of control, surveillance and exhaustion.

left,Romy Achituv & Camille Utterback,Interactive Art,"Text Rain is an iconic interactive installation that invites viewers to use their bodies to interact with falling letters on a projected screen. As participants move in front of the display, the letters respond in real-time -  appearing to land on their arms, shoulders, or hands, much like rain collecting on a surface. As viewers collect letters with their movements, they begin to notice that some of the letters form coherent words. With time and attention, those words reveal lines of a poem embedded within the falling text. This adds a deeper layer of meaning to the interaction - turning what first feels like a playful, ephemeral experience into a more reflective one. This piece stands out to me for its elegance and emotional resonance.
